This repository contains the source files for the paper titled "Enhancing Newborn Health Assessment: Ultrasound-based Body Composition Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques" published in the Ultrasound for Medicine &amp; Biology November 2025 edition. For further inquires, please contact rangerlabbc@gmail.com

## Project Overview

This project explores deep learning–based methods for predicting newborn body composition, specifically fat-mass and fat-free mass using ultrasound imaging.
We implement and evaluate multiple approaches—including UNet segmentation, Grad-CAM explainability, and feature-based techniques like HOG and SIFT—to assess model performance and interpretability.
